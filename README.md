This is a simple app I wrote to help me learn Zed.

1. Clone this repo
2. Open in Zed
3. `cargo run`
4. Open `tutorial.txt` file in Zed
5. Follow instructions
6. If you are stuck, empty the file to skip to next task.

Complete instructions using hints provided and your [Black Belt mastery](https://zed.dev/blog/text-manipulation).

After completing the task, hit "save" and next tutorial will be loaded.
