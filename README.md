This is a simple app I wrote to help me learn Zed.

1. Clone this repo
2. Open in Zed
3. `cargo run`
4. Open `tutorial.txt` file in Zed
5. Follow instructions, don't use the mouse
6. If you are stuck, empty the file to skip to next task.

This app populates `tutorial.txt` with a random task. When you save
the file and if the task is complete, next task will be loaded.

The goal is to keep training your muscle memory and remember advanced
Zed / Vim keystrokes. Inspired by:
[Black Belt Blog post](https://zed.dev/blog/text-manipulation).
